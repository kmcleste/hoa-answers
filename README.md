# HOA Question-Answer System

## Project Setup

Pre-requisites: python3.7 or higher, docker

1. Create a new virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash
    streamlit run app-ui.py
    ```

    You should automatically be taken to a new webpage. If not, go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser. Here you will see a simple form to provide text input. Ask the system a question and you will receive an answer in json form. Below is an example of what you should see.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- This entire system is built upon compounding errors.
