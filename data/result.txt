Directors may, without a vote of the Class A Members, levy special assessments to cover the shortfall.

Responsibility will require the consent of at least eighty percent (86%) of the Class A votes held by Members other

Areas of Limited Common Responsibility may be designated as such in the deed conveying such area to the
Association or on the Plat relating to such Areas of Common Responsibility; provided, however, any such assignment
shall not preclude Declarant from later assigning use of the same Areas of Limited Common Responsibility to
additional Lots, so long as Declarant has a right to subject additional property to this Declaration pursuant to ARTICLE
Il, and provided further that any assignment that would have a material adverse effect on Lots owned by a Builder or
Lots a Builder is under contract to purchase from Declarant will require the consent of such Builder, which consent

of Common Responsibility as Resource Conservation Areas. Use of portions of the Areas of Common Responsibility
designated as Resource Conservation Areas will be limited or prohibited as provided in the delineation.

Resource Conservation Area will not relieve any Owner of the obligation to comply with al! laws, rules, and permits.

into reserve funds maintained by the Association. The Board of Directors shall thereupon adopt a budget for the
Association's expenditures and reserves based upon such estimate and providing for the total annual assessment to be
fevied against the Members of the Association for such fiscal year (the total assessment which shall be so determined
and levied for any fiscal year is herein referred to as the “Annual Assessment”), If North Carolina law requires that
the Owners approve the budget, the budget shall be approved by the Owners in the manner and through the procedures
specified by North Carolina law and as specified in the Bylaws.

 

The assessments provided for herein shall commence as to a Lot on the date that Declarant transfers

the Lot. Each Owner of an Improved Lot shall pay a portion of the Annual Assessment that will be calculated by

* multiplying the total Annual Assessment by a fraction, the denominator will be the number of Lots and the numerator
will be the number of Lots that Owner owns. Each Builder shall pay a portion of the Annual assessment that will be
calculated by multiplying the total Annual Assessment by a fraction, the denominator will be the number of Lots and

Association by the persons liable therefore, the budget adopted by the Board of Directors for any fiscal year shall
prove to be inadequate to defray the Annual Expenses for such fiscal year, or if the Board of Directors shall determine
that it is im the best interests of the Association to levy a special assessment to pay the costs of any capital
improvements or capital repairs, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to levy a special assessment against
the Lots and the Owners thereof to raise such needed funds. Any special assessment levied by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be payable at such times and such installments as the Board of Directors
shail determine. Each Improved Lot shall be liable for the payment of an equal share of every special assessment-

not the result of ordinary wear and tear, (ii) for the payment of fines, penalties or other charges imposed against an
individual Owner relative to such Owner’s failure to comply with the terms and provisions of this Declaration, the

disproportionately benefit all Lots (which expenses may be specially assessed equitably among all of the Lots which
are benefited according to the benefit received), provided that in no event shall Declarant be obligated to pay any
specific assessment. Failure of the Board to exercise its authority under this Section shall not be grounds for any
action against the Association or the Board of Directors and shall not constitute a waiver of the Board’s right to
exercise its authority under this Section in the future with respect to any expenses.

notice of the amount and due date of such specific assessment to the affected Owner(s) at least thirty (30) days prior

Lot a sum equal to no greater than a single Annual Assessment shall be collected from the purchaser of such Lot and
transferred to the Association as part of its working capital. The purpose of the working capital fund is to ensure that
the Association will have adequate cash available to meet its initial operating expenses or to acquire additional
equipment or services deemed by the Board of Directors to be necessary or desirable. Amounts paid to the Association
pursuant to this Section shall not be considered as an advance payment of any Tegular assessment.

Section 6.07 Neighborhood Assessments. The Board may specifically assess Owners of Lots within

benefit received.

year being specified in the Bylaws), the Board shall prepare a separate budget covering the estimated Neighborhood
expenses for the coming year. During the Development Period, the Board shall determine the level of services to be |

Townhome Lots which are designated as one (1) Neighborhood called the “Townhome Neighborhood,” and all
Temaining Lots are hereby designated as one (1) Neighborhood called the “Single-Family Detached Neighborhood.”
The Declarant, in its sole discretion, may establish additional Neighborhoods within the Property by amendment to
the Declaration and/or Plats in order to subject such Lots to additional covenants and restrictions or to benefit said
Lots differently from other Lots on the Property. During the Development Period, the Declarant may unilaterally
amend this Declaration and any plat from time to time to assign property to a specific Neighborhood, to redesignate
Neighborhood boundaries, or to remove property from a specific Neighborhood.

Neighborhood may at any time petition the Board of Directors to divide the property comprising their Neighbothood
into two (2) or more Neighborhoods. Such petition shall be in writing and shall include a survey of the entire parcel
which indicates the proposed boundaries of the new Neighborhoods or otherwise identifies the Lots to be included
within the proposed Neighborhoods. Such petition shall be deemed granted thirty (30) days following the filing of all
required documents with the Board unless the Board denies such application in writing within such thirty (30) day
period. The Board may deny any application only upon determination that there is no reasonable basis for
distinguishing between the areas proposed to be divided into separate Neighborhoods. The Owners requesting the
division shall be responsible for any expenses incurred with respect to implementing a division of a Neighborhood,
including but not limited to a revised plat, if the application is approved.

Any Neighborhood may, but shall not be required to, elect a Neighborhood committee to represent the
interests of the Owners in such Neighborhood. No Neighborhood commitiee shall be formed, however without the
ptior submission to and written approval of the Board of Directors.

Any Neighborhood may request that the Association provide a higher level of service or special services for
the benefit of Lots in such Neighborhood and upon written consent of a majority of Owners of the Lots within the
Neighborhood, the Association may, im its sole discretion, provide the requested services. The cost of such service,
which may include a reasonable administrative charge in such amount as the Board may deem appropriate (provided
such administrative charge shall apply at a uniform rate per Lot to all Neighborhoods receiving the same service),

shall be assessed against the Lots within such Neighborhood as a Neighborhood Assessment pursuant to ARTICLE
VI herein.

No action may be taken by a Neighborhood which is adverse to the interests of the Association or its Members
or that is inconsistent with the Community Wide Standards. If the Neighborhood fails to comply with such
requirements of the Association as specified by the Association in writing the Association may assess the Lots within
such Neighborhood for any expense incurred by the Association to correct the inconsistency or deficiency,

Claimant on account of such Arbitral Dispute; provided, nothing herein shall release or discharge such party or parties

The existing parties to the Arbitral Dispute shall cooperate in good faith to ensure that all necessary
and appropriate parties are included in the arbitration proceeding. No Declarant shall be required to participate in the
arbitration proceeding if all parties against whom a Declarant would have necessary or permissive cross-claims or
counterclaims are not or cannot be joined in the arbitration proceedings. Subject to the limitations imposed in this
Section 14.03, the arbitrator shall have the authority to try all issues, whether of fact or law.

(a) Place. The arbitration proceedings shall be heard in the County wheze the Property is located.

(v) Commencement and Timing of Proceeding. Arbitration may not be commenced or prosecuted by or on
bebalf of the Association unless approved by at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Lot Owners which
approval must be accompanied by the approval of a reasonable arbitration budget and the approval and
collection of a Special Assessment in an amount equal to the budget to be levied equally among the Lots and

(e) Extingmishment of Inferior Liens. Foreclosure of the Association’s continuing lien for assessments
terminates, extinguishes and forever discharges all inferior or subordinate liens and encumbrances (being all
Jiens and encumbrances except as provided by Section 6.10) as to the affected Lot. The foregoing applies to
judicial and non-judicial foreclosure of the Association’s continuing lien for assessments regardless of
whether or not the holder of the inferior or subordinate lien or encumbrance is made a party to or given notice
of any proceedings in connection therewith, including without limitation to the fullest extent permitted by

law whether or not made a party to or given notice of any judicial foreclosure suit and any other proceedings
in connection therewith.

Section 6.09 Effect of Foreclosure or Bankruptcy. The effect of judicial or non-judicial foreclosure of a lien
which is superior to the Association’s continuing assessment lien under this Declaration, or acceptance of a deed in
lieu thereof, and the effect of the discharge of an Owner in bankruptcy is determined as of the date of foreclosure, the
date of signing of a deed in lieu which is accepted by the grantee or the date of filing of the bankruptcy in which the
Owner is discharged, as the case may be (the “Discharge Date”), Foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu as
aforesaid does not relieve the former Owner from the personal obligation for payment of assessments due as of the
Discharge Date, but does release the Association’s continuing assessment lien as to and only as to assessments due
prior to the Discharge Date. The purchaser at foreclosure or grantee under a deed in lieu and an Owner discharged in
bankruptcy is also relieved from any obligation for payment of assessments due prior to the Discharge Date, but is
obligated to pay all assessments assessed or assessable from and after the Discharge Date and the Association’s
continuing assessment lien fully secures payment of said assessments. For purposes of the foregoing “assessments
assessed or assessable” means (i) prorated regular annual assessments based on the number of months remaining in
the calendar year in which the Discharge Date occurs regardless of whether the applicable regular annual assessment
is payable in advance annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and (ii) any instailments for special assessments so payable
which become due after the Discharge Date.

 

Section 6.10 Revival of Assessment Lien. The Association’s assessment lien is automatically revived as to any
Owner who reacquires ownership of the applicable Lot within two (2) years after the Discharge Date (as defined in
the immediately preceding Section) to the same effect as if none of the events causing the Discharge Date to occur
had occurred if ownership is reacquired from the purchaser at foreclosure, the prantee under the deed in lieu of
foreclosure, or any successor in title to such purchaser or grantee and the reacquisition of ownership constitutes a

fraudulent transfer under Chapter 39 of the North Carolina General Statutes or under any other state or federal statutes
or laws.

Section 9.02 ~ Individual Insurance. Each Owner, by virtue of taking title to a Lot subject to this Declaration,
acknowledges that the Association has no obligation to provide any insurance for any portion of individual Lots. Each
Owner covenants and agrees with all other Owners and with the Association that each Owner will maintain at ail times
all-risk casualty insurance as well as a liability policy covering damage or injury occurring on a Lot. The casualty
insurance shall cover loss or damage by fire and other hazards commonly insured under an all-risk policy, ifreasonably
available, and shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the full replacement cost of any repair or reconstruction of a
covered item in the event of damage or destruction from any such hazard,

The Board has the right, but not the obligation, to require the Owner to furnish a copy of such
insurance policy or policies to the Association. In the event that any such Owner fails to obtain insurance as required
by this Section, the Association has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase such insurance on behalf of the Owner
and to assess the cost thereof to the Owner, to be collected in the manner provided for collection of assessments herein.

Upon request by the Board, the Owner shall furnish a copy of such insurance policy or policies to
the Association.

Section 9.03 Additional Insurance Requirements.

 

The Board of Directors shall utilize reasonable efforts to include the following provisions in the
policies that the Association obtains:

(a) waiver of the insurer's rights of subrogation of any claims against directors, officers, the managing agent, the
individual Owners, occupants, and their respective household members;

(b) an agreed value endorsement and an inflation guard endorsement; and

(c) until the expiration of thirty (30) days after the insurer gives notice in writing to the Mortgagee of any Lot,
the Mortgagee’s insurance coverage will not be affected or jeopardized by any act or conduct of the Owner
of such Lot, the other Owners, the Board of Directors, or any of their agents, employees, or household
tmembers, nor be canceled for nonpayment of premiums.

All policies of insurance shall be written with a company licensed to do business in the State of
North Carolina, Exclusive authority to adjust losses under policies obtained by the Association shall be vested in the
Association’s Board of Directors; provided, however, no Mortgagee having an interest in such losses may be
prohibited from participating in the settlement negotiations, if any, related thereto.

Nothing contained herein gives any Owner or other party a priority over the rights of first
Mortgagees as to distribution of insurance proceeds. Any insurance proceeds payable to the Owner of a Lot on which
there is a Mortgagee endorsement shall be disbursed jointly to such Lot Owner and the Mortgagee. This is a covenant
for the benefit of any such Mortgagee and may be enforced by any such Mortgagee. In the event of an insured loss,
any required deductible shall be considered a maintenance expense to be paid by the person or persons who would be
tesponsible for such loss in the absence of insurance. If the loss affects more than one Lot, the cost of the deductible
may be apportioned equitably by the Board among the parties suffering loss in proportion to each affected Owner’s
portion of the total cost of repair. Notwithstanding this, if the insurance policy provides that the deductible will apply
to each Lot separately or to each occurrence, each Lot Owner shall be responsibie for paying the deductible pertaining
to his or her Lot, if any. If any Owner or Owners fail to pay the deductible when required under this subparagraph,
then the Association may pay the deductible and assess the cost to the Owner or Owners pursuant 10 the terms of this
Declaration. .

Additionally, the Association shall obtain such msurance coverage as is necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, if and to the extent
applicable to the Property.
