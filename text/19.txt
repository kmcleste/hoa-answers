as a debt; (y) the right and power to foreclose the Association's continuing lien for
assessments by all methods available for the enforcement of a mortgage, deed of trust or
any other contractual lien, including foreclosure by an action brought in the name of the
Association either judicially or non-judicialiy by power of sale; and (z) a coatinuing power
of sale in connection with the non-judicial foreclosure of the Association's continuing lien
for assessments as herein provided.

The Board of Directors or the then President of the Association may appoint, in writing, at
any time and from time to time, an officer, agent, trustee, or attorney of the Association
(the "Trustee") to exercise the power of sale on behalf of and as the agent of the
Association, including without limitation to deliver and file the notices required by the
Chapter 47F of the North Carolina General Statutes (the “Code”), and to conduct the sale
and to otherwise comply with said statute. The Board of Directors or the then President of
the Association may, at any time and from time to time, remove any such Trustee and
appoint a successor or substitute Trustee without further formality than an appointment and
designation in writing. Except as otherwise provided by this Declaration, the Association
will exercise its power of sale pursuant to the Code. The Association has the right and
power to bid on any Lot at any foreclosure sale, either judicial or non-judicial, and to
acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the same.

If directed by the Association to foreclose the Association’s continuing lien, Trustee will,

’ either personally or by agent, give notice of the foreclosure sale as required by the Code as
then in effect, and sell and convey all or part of the applicable property “AS IS”, “WHERE
IS”, and ‘WITH ALL FAULTS” to the highest bidder, subject to prior liens, encumbrances
and any other matters of record and without representation or warranty, express or implied,
by Trustee or the Association. The Association must indemnify Trustee and hold Trustee
harmless from and against all costs, expenses, and liabilities incurred by Trustee for acting
in the execution or enforcement of the Association’s lien or otherwise pursuant to this
Declaration, including indemnification for all court and other costs, and attorney’s fees
incurred by Trustee in defense of any action or proceeding taken against Trustee regarding
any of the foregoing.

The filing of suit to collect any sums due hereunder or to foreclose the Association's
continuing lien for assessments may never be considered an election so as to preclude
exercise of any other rights or remedies, including without limitation foreclosure under
power of sale before or after a final judgment. After foreclosure, either judicial or non-
judicial, the former Owner and anyone claiming under the former Owner must immediately
surrender possession to the purchaser. Ifnot, the former Owner and anyone claiming under
the former Owner will be mere tenants at sufferance of the purchaser, and the purchaser
may obtain immediate possession pursuant to any actions or remedies permitted by law,
including an action for forcible detainer or eviction to be maintainable by the purchaser.

Each owner, by acquisition of any Lot, specifically covenants and stipulates as to each and
every Trustee's foreclosure sale that the recitals in any appointment or designation of
Trustee, any conveyance by the Trustee and any affidavit of the Trustee or the Association
related thereto is full proof and evidence of the matters therein stated, that all prerequisites
of the foreclosure sale are presumed to have been performed, and that the foreclosure sale
Toade under the powers herein granted is a perpetual bar against the Owner(s) of the Lot(s)
sold and their heirs, executors and administrators, successors and assigns, and any Persons
whatsoever claiming or to claim thereunder.

Without limitation of any other provisions of this Declaration, Declarant, during the
Development Period, or the Board of Directors thereafter, are hereby specifically
authorized to amend Section 6.08 in any manner deemed necessary or appropriate as
regarding or to conform to applicable provisions or requirements of the North Carolina
General Statutes and/or applicable mules pertaining thereto without the jomder or consent
of any Owner or any other Person.
