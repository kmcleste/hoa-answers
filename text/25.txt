be subject to enforcement action by the Association, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Association may, in its sole discretion, either restore the Lot to the condition that existed before construction

began or may complete construction, either at the Owner's costs and with lien nights created herein and under

Section, and such certificate shall be conclusive as to whether the same is in such compliance,

Property (i) without application having been first made and approval obtained as provided in subparagraph
(a) of this Section, (ii) in a manner that deviates from the plans approved by the ARC, or (iii) without prompt
completion, as determined by the ARC, said work shall be deemed to be in violation of this covenant, and

whose Property said work was undertaken or performed may, in the case of unapproved work, be required to
restore to its original condition, at his sole expense, the property upon which said work was undertaken or
performed, or in the case of approved work, complete the work promptly and in strict compliance with
approved plans. Upon the failure or refusal of any Person to perform the work required herein, the ARC, or
their authorized agents or employees, may, after fourteen (14) days' notice to such Person, enter upon the
property, and make such restoration or complete such work as the ARC, in the exercise of its discretion, may
deem necessary or advisable. The Person upon whose property such work shall have been performed shall

single Lot shall be thereafter liable shall be equal to the total assessments for which all of the Lots that were combined
would have been liable had such combination not taken place.
